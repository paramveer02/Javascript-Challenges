/*
Coding Challenge #1

Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
'brake' multiple times on each of them

Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
*/

function Car(make, speed) {
  this.make = make;
  this.speed = speed;
}

Car.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed = this.speed + 10;
  console.log(`Increased Speed of ${this.make}: ${this.speed}`);
};

Car.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed = this.speed - 5;
  console.log(`Reduced Speed of ${this.make}: ${this.speed}`);
};

const bmw = new Car("BMW", 100);
const mercedes = new Car("MERCEDES", 120);
console.log(bmw.make);
console.log(bmw.speed);

bmw.accelerate();
mercedes.accelerate();
bmw.brake();
mercedes.brake();
