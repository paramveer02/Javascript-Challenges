/*
Coding Challenge #14

Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in underscore_case
and convert them to camelCase.
The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below to
insert the elements), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.

Test data (pasted to textarea, including spaces):
underscore_case
first_name
Some_Variable
 calculate_AGE
delayed_departure

Should produce this output (5 separate console.log outputs):

underscoreCase ✅
firstName ✅✅
someVariable ✅✅✅
calculateAge ✅✅✅✅
delayedDeparture ✅✅✅✅✅
