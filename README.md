# JavaScript Coding Challenges 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from the [Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann (Udemy).

As a self-taught developer, I completed the course and am solving these challenges independently to practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation, and advanced concepts.
